# Icons Folder

This folder can contain custom icon assets if needed.

## Usage

Icons in this folder can be used with:
```dart
Image.asset('assets/icons/icon_name.png')
```

## Note

The app currently uses `flutter_lucide` package for icons, so custom icon files may not be necessary unless you have specific brand icons.
